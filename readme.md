# Vaccuum framework

> Lightweight PHP API micro-framework.

### Why another framework?

There are some PHP micro frameworks out there, `true`.

However, the goal of this project is to provide a framework 
with a specific purpose. This is, for creating simple and fast API's.

Most of other frameworks tries to be a solution for every problem.
While this may work it tends to produce bloated frameworks and 
every (almost) of them strive to win the competition with some
new & shiny features every version and bloating even more.

This is not the case with vaccuum framework.
